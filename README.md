# Learning Italian


## https://spaced-repetition-plum.vercel.app/

This project uses spaced repetition to teach Italian. After creating an account, the user guesses the translation for the Italian word and the next page shows if they got the word right or wrong.

For each user, score is kept on how many times they have guessed on the word, the correct and incorrect number of guesses on each word.

### Future Plans
- For personal use, I'm currently in the process of adding more languages and adding the 100 most used words of those languages. 
- I'll also be adding an extra page where the user gets to choose the language. 
- Unit testing will be added as well.
